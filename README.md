# Hand-Digit-Recognition-using-Machine-Learning
This project is a classic introductory machine-learning task that demonstrates the complete workflow of building, training, evaluating, and visualizing a classification model. It uses a well-known dataset (load_digits) from scikit-learn, which contains grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9).

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can automatically recognize handwritten digits from images. Each image is 8×8 pixels (total 64 pixel values), and the model predicts which digit (0–9) the image represents.

This project shows how machine learning can convert pixel intensity patterns into meaningful predictions.
